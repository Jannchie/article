[BiliOB](https://www.biliob233.com/) is a web site that I made. I inadvertently used some Gestalt-related design tricks when I designed it.

For example, this is a list component. The list can be swiped left and right. This component is designed to comply with the Gestalt closure law. When an element is missing or disconnected, we look for a consistent, smooth pattern. In other words, we try and consciously fill in the blanks. The item on the right of the image is only half shown, indicating that there is more to the right of the list, which can be swiped.

Using Material Design, the site is divided into several sections by cards with the same spacing for each card. This follows the principle of proximity in Gestalt design principles. The inside of the cards is close, indicating that they are a subject. There is space between the cards so that they are not incorrectly connected.

The human mind craves to find "balance" in a human face and to find aesthetic pleasure in it. The brain also tends to find symmetry in other objects, such as images, because symmetry creates harmony and allows the viewer to feel comfortable while viewing the image.

As you can see, the site's graphic design follows the principle of symmetry. There are a total of four charts symmetrically distributed in the picture, representing their position is the same. And asymmetry can be confusing.
