In the interaction between human and computer, besides Verbal channel, Nonverbal channels, such as gesture, voice, appearance and eyes, are more important. Nonverbal influence on people's feelings accounted for more than 55%.

When communicating, people consciously or unconsciously synchronize their gestures, postures, speech, facial expressions, eye contact, etc. This synchronization can be a sign of a successful communication -- because successful communication tends to lead to more Nonverbal Sync.

We can use this synchronization theory in human-machine agent interaction to improve user experience. For example, there is a synchronous proxy for head movements. It's a VR device that mimics the head movements of a real person to make the experience more realistic. Another example is Facial expression spread emotion. Virtual VR characters make happy faces, and they can convey this happy emotion to the user. For example, in the application of man-machine conversation, if the computer agent can pause a little can make people feel more friendly.

Professor Nozawa's research mainly involves Nonverbal synchronization. Especially the Nonverbal Sync for person-to-person communication.

Professor Nozawa's team collected human activity Data through multi-modal Sensing, and then used ML and AI technologies for Data analysis. A synchronization data visualization system between people has been successfully established. This visualization system could describe the synchronization of physical motions in the form of matrices and graphs.

We can use this system to analyze the class. In a very bad classroom environment, teachers and students may have a lot of physical activities, and the classroom is very messy. However, in a classroom dominated by teachers, only teachers have many physical activities, while students have few physical activities. In the absence of synchronization between teachers and students, the class efficiency is not high. In a better classroom environment, the activities of teachers and students are not too large and synchronized.

In addition, research has found that physical synchrony can predict changes in mood. Higher physical synchrony predicts more positive emotional shifts. In addition, the prediction based on independent physical activities is not accurate, and multimodal synchronization can significantly improve the prediction results.
