In apps, we often see the design of drop-down lists that bounce back and refresh the contents of the list. Many pull-down refreshes are simply text prompts and it is not intuitive. By adding some animation, the user can be more visually aware of the bounce effect of the drop-down action.

For example, in the image shown above, a deformed animation appears at the top edge of the list when you pull it down. It looks like elastic potential energy has been built up, and an image of a rocket is shown above, implying that releasing a touch will launch it. This is an example of visual feedback creating a pseudo-haptics of touch by adding a series of animations that enable the user to create the tactile illusion of a point-pull spring based on physical and life experience. This design is both practical and aesthetic.

By doing this, we can omit the text prompt and make it more intuitive for the user to understand the meaning of the user's actions. And this kind of creative animation makes the application very refined.
