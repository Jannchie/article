The rubber hand illusion is an experience in which healthy individuals perceive a non-physical prosthetic hand as part of their real body. The illusion can be created by simultaneously brushing both the visible rubber hand and the invisible real hand in front of the subject's face.

In many first-person games, this is the illusion. We use the mouse to change the direction of our eyes, but many people try to change the direction of their eyes by turning their heads while playing the game.

In a famous game, Resident Evil 7. If you play a game with a gamepad, the gamepad will vibrate when attacked, and the graphics will wobble accordingly. It's very easy to immerse yourself in the scene and have a very immersive experience. Players may even get scared into dropping gamepads while playing a game. This takes advantage of the rubber hand illusion. The hand in the screen is treated as the player's hand, and the damage taken by the character in the game is reflected on the player's own hand.

In VR games, the rubber hand illusion can be used more widely. With this illusion, we don't need to use sophisticated technical means to give the player real sensory stimulation, but we just need to work on creating realistic images that will make the player feel the illusion themselves. After all, the brain is the best graphics card and CPU.

Therefore, I think the rubber hand illusion can be applied to first person games and all VR games. Properly used, this illusion can greatly improve the player's experience.
