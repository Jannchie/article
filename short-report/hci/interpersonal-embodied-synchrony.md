There's a 5v5 MOBA game called Honor of Kings. The pace of the game is fast, so players have little time to communicate with other teammates in text, and most people, either because they can't speak out loud or because the players themselves are shy and don't want to communicate by voice. So the game communicates primarily by sending certain signals. For example, if you click on some area on the map, you want to go to that place. Or you can click on an enemy's avatar to tell your teammates that they need to watch out for that enemy.

In most other games of the same kind, the signal is one-way, and you can't get direct feedback from your teammates after you send it. The player has no way of knowing whether the person receiving the signal agrees with the sender or chooses to ignore the sender's message.

Honor of Kings has innovated by adding a quick response feature that allows a teammate to send a feedback signal indicating that they have received the signal and promise to take action.

This innovation greatly increases the player's sense of participation in the collaboration. Added a mechanic that makes players more likely to work together as a team, rather than as individuals. I think this is a direct application of the interpersonal embodied synchrony theory.
