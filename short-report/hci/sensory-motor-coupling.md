Schaft recently showed off a biped robot with an unusual leg mechanism.

This particularly attractive leg structure avoids some problems, such as using the knee to lift the foot, and is flexible in the demo video. In addition, the use of such a linear drive structure, the motor torque requirements may be lower than the knee leg lift.

The center of gravity of this robot is relatively low, which reduces the difficulty of control to some extent. Should be able to reduce certain design costs. But there are some limitations. It is impossible to make it extremely small.

For this technique, the sensory-motor coupling is used. From the point of view of principle, the walking problem of biped robot can be simplified as: obtaining the data of the robot's body position and the transformation of the center of gravity through various sensors, then calculating reasonable and effective motion instructions, and then feeding back and calculating.
